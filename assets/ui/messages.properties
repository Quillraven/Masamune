dialog.elder_00.page1=Hello {0},\n\
as you may have already heard, monsters have returned to the forest!\n\
The forest is as deadly as it was 200 years ago. Something must have happened to the sacred sword {{COLOR=ROYAL}Masamune{{CLEARCOLOR}.\n\
I fear that the protective spell my great-grandfather cast is weakening.
dialog.elder_00.page2=Unfortunately, I am too old and too weak to look for the sword myself.\n\
You, {0}, are the only one here in the village who knows how to handle the sword, and thanks to your mother, you also master the art of magic.
dialog.elder_00.page3=You must find the sword and protect it with a new spell.\n\
I will give you the spell and my sword.\n\
You will find {COLOR=ROYAL}Masamune{CLEARCOLOR} in the forest clearing deep in the woods.\n\n\
\
Go now!
dialog.elder_10.page1=Hurry up and renew the protective spell! Also stop by the blacksmith and the merchant. They're sure to have useful items for your journey.
dialog.flower_girl_00.page1=Hey {0},\n\
You've probably heard that monsters have moved back into the forest. It's too risky for me to go in there and look for plants anymore.\n\
The thing is, I don't just sell pretty flowers. I need to find special herbs and plants to keep our village healthy.\n\
My brother is really sick with a strange illness. The only way I can help him is to find the Terealis plant.
dialog.flower_girl_00.page2=I'm not very good with a sword, so you'll have to help me with that, {0}.\n\
But I'm sure it won't be a problem for you!
dialog.flower_girl_00.page3=The Terealis plant is very rare, but if it's blooming anywhere around this time of year, it'll be in the western part of the forest.\n\
Search for the plant there. I'll wait here for you.\n\
Please hurry! My brother is getting sicker by the day.
dialog.flower_girl_10.page1=Please hurry {0}! My brother is already feeling very bad.
dialog.merchant_00.page1=Welcome!\n\
You will need my goods if you want to survive out there.\n\
Have a look!
